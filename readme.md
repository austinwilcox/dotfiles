# Dotfiles
Here are my dotfiles containing the config for neovim, leftwm, tmux, bash, alacritty and a couple of other small configs

## Stow
I use stow to place all these files in the correct location with symlinks, the commands are:
```bash
stow .
```
and
```bash
stow -D .
```
to delete those symlinks
